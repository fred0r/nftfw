v0.7.11 Check and update released patterns for detecting exim4
	problems - original rules were not parsing IP addresses
	correctly. Look in newly installed
	.../etc/nftfw/original/patterns/exim4.patterns
	and update your working copy in
	.../etc/nftfw/patterns.d/exim4.patterns

v0.7.10 Ignore errors when reading UTF-8 files.
	Attempted in 0.7.7 but incorrectly implemented. RTFM.
	Replacing by backslashes only works on write.

v0.7.9 	Some minor cosmetic changes
	Make blacklist tidy be aware of timezones
	Make 'drop' the default rule for incoming table,
	may be better to slow down port scans
	Add pyproject.toml
	Add better ipaddress selection to cidrlist/getcountrynet
	Small changes to the Installation documents, some text tidying and
	some notes about installation on the Raspberry Pi OS
	Fix default regular expressions in patterns.d/exim4.patterns
	it needed to be make more specific so that HELO's with IP
	addresses are ignored in the log file and the sender address
	is used.

v0.7.8  Fix Nftfwls which didn't cope with IP addresses not found in the
        MaxMind database.

v0.7.7  Ignore UTF-8 errors in logfiles. Replace offending text
	with backslashed values.

v0.7.6  Ignore broken error in nftfwls. Happened when using
	nftfwls -a into the head command
	Fix incorrectly formatted help messages for
	nftfwedit.

v0.7.5  Expand documentation on nftfw_init.nft changing the
	How Do I document and the nftfw_files man page.

v0.7.4	Fix shell coding error in Install.sh. POSIX shells need
	explicit path names when using '.' commands unless . is in
	PATH.

	Test and supply a zsh 'workaround' to cope with the
	problem it supplies when dealing with spaces in variables.

	Make the ftp-passive more robust. It's really intended to
	be used with pure-ftp, and will need hand editing if pure
	is not installed. Now it will just generate nothing if it's not
	set up properly. Not sure if this is a good thing, will people
	look to see if it's working?

v0.7.3	Automate Install.sh as suggested by mrbluecoat on github.
	The install script now looks for Autoinstall.conf and takes
	its answers from there. This file is ignored by git so can be
	retained and used for later updates.

v0.7.2  Add -a (altered) flag to nftfw to print changes in
	config from the compiled in values. Can replace config.ini
	by the values.

v0.7.1  Add necessary change to the systemd setup to report on
	the blacknets.d directory.
	Documentation update.

v0.7.0	Add blacknets.d to etc/nftfw - containing files with lists of
	network CIDR ranges that can block countries and other
	unwanted groups based on ip range. The code understands that
	ipv4 addresses can be expressed as ipv6 addresses.
	The code checks that overlapping ranges are suppressed.

	Provide sample infrastructure to allow automatic downloads
	of GeoIP country CIDR ranges.
	Updated documentation
	Update Install.sh to flag if config.ini and nftfw_init.nft
	needs updating.

v0.6.0  Revised some comments that were a little obscure.
	Add new entry to the How Do I Document
	Replace incron use by systemd path service
	Revise scheduler to remove incron flag which isn't needed.
	Replace use of incron by a systemd path service
	which seems to do the job.
	Code changed to remove incron flag and change to
	scheduler which makes it work without either incron
	or systemd.
	Incron references removed from documentation.
	Installation instructions updated

v0.5.1  Pure FTP needs to allow access to a port range on input
	for it to work. Add new rule - ftp-passive.sh to determine
	the range from /etc/pure-ftpd/conf/PassivePortRange and
	then add it to the allowed inbound ports. Put 21-ftp-passive in
	incoming.d to include the range.

v0.5.0  Tag a new release

v0.4.5  Don't use interval sets by default for blacklist and whitelist
	sets. This is a change in distributed config rather than
	functionality. Use of the system has found that certain
	national actors frequently use adjacent IP addresses and
	this triggers the nft bug causing table reloads to fail.

v0.4.4  v0.4.2 removed intervals from sets as well as merge
	intervals are needed for ipv6

v0.4.3	Make the pattern reader regex compilation more robust.
	Ignore case when compiling regexes for log scanning (should
	have done this before).
	Only allow one regex group in the match, so that brackets ()
	in patterns now must be prefixed by a back slash.

	Upgraded test suite initialisation. Prevents the nftfw code
	from timing out any blacklist entries by touching the files
	in the reference 'data' directory.
	The initialise script is now called from the Makefile if the
	'data' directory is empty.

v0.4.2  Added blacklist_set_auto_merge and whitelist_set_auto_merge to
	config.ini.

        These two variables control the type of sets automatically
	generated for blacklist and whitelist tables. When true, nftfw
	uses auto_merged, interval sets for the blacklist or whitelist
	sets it makes. This set type automatically create single entries
	containing an address range for adjacent IP addresses. The feature
	is desirable because it reduces the number of matches.

        However, at present, the auto-merged, interval sets can cause the
	nft program to fail, flagging an error. There is a bug causing nft
	to succeed in loading the set when a full install is performed but
	failing when attempting a reload.

        The bug has been reported to the nftables development team, but no
	fix has been generated as of the current releases. nftfw will work
	around this bug, automatically generating a full install when an
	attempt at a set reload fails. However, it seems a good idea to
	provide a way of turning this feature off.

	Added hostname printing into the print function of nftfwedit, made
	optional using a command line option, because it can be slow
	when printing many addresses with no hostname.



v0.4.1  Removed reject-www-data from default outgoing setting
	advice says that this causes more problems than it solves

v0.4.0  Change the README.md file, lots of what was there is
	now in other files.

v0.3.4  More documentation changes, make the geoiplocation code more
	robust.

v0.3.3  Change internal database interface slightly
	Add reset of missing files in blacklist.d, this has never happened
	but might.
	Update documentation

v0.3.2 	New document 'Installation Instructions'
	Augment logic in fwmanage. When adding a new IP into an set that
	creates a range, the partial load fails. Now test the partial load
	and do a full install when needed

v0.3.1  Put back the code that allows nftfwls to run
	without the python geoip2 package.
	Typo fixes in documents suggested by hairydog
	Changes to the Installation document
	New document 'Installing GeoLocation'
	New document 'Updating nftfw'

v0.2.3	Small change to the Installation document
	Added extra tests to test_04

v0.2.2  Added a set of pytest tests, which pulled out some omissions
	in checking, rather than actual bugs. See README files in
	the test directory. Added a Makefile to make linting the main
	source simpler.
	Tests needed a standalone bootstrap system, added to makefile
	Changed the way that ftp-helper is implemented

v0.2.1  Just when it looked fine, noticed an omission in the ipv6
	setup.

v0.2.0  Make a release - it seems to be functioning as expected


v0.1.9  Add some frequency stats to nftfwedit and log values from
	blacklist - puts some of the number into context

v0.1.8	Redo the management of Debian logger and how config.py interacts
	with other modules. New module loggermanager.py does this, and
	provides better control of what is happening.

	Large name changes to bring the code up to pylint standard, except
	I allow 1 and 2 character variable names, which are extremely
	local.
	argument-rgx=[a-z_][a-z0-9_]{0,30}$
	attr-rgx=[a-z_][a-z0-9_]{0,30}$
	also add 'log' to good-names otherwise it complains a lot
	about the log calls

	Revise commenting strategy to make is somewhat more formal


v0.1.7  Redo set naming algorithm.
	Change default blacklist action to drop which
	causes less traffic.
	Remove .patterns from argument to nftfw -p
	Fix a misconception in the nftfw_init.nft
	file.

v0.1.6	Blacklist won't blacklist addresses or networks
	in whitelist.d
	Reworked IP address checking into one place

v0.1.5  Fix typos in code highlighted by the installation
	on a vanilla Sympl system
	Update Installation document to incorporate things
 	learnt from the installation exercise

v0.1.4  Ensure glob in pattern match resolves to
	unique set of canonical files.
	Some amount of pythonification
	Add to installation documentation

v0.1.3 	Add nftfwedit to print info on IPs, and provide
	command line access to add, delete and blacklist
	ips.
	Documentation update

v0.1.2  Amend logging for blacklist detection to give an indication
	of what pattern triggered it.
	Add sample web page for nftfwls -w
	Add user control: files automatically created in etc/nftfw
	will be owned by user nominated in config.ini, this follows
	Symbiosis/Sympl practice of making files in etc/nftfw
	accessible to a non-root admin user
	Install.sh now asks for user name

v0.1.1 	Tidy links in documents
	Flatten distribution - removing original file tree for system.
	Replace 'dist' in etc_nftfw by 'original' to avoid
	problems with python package names.
	Seems like a good idea to have a ChangeLog.
	Change blacklist algorithm somewhat, realising
	that the update option needs to update times on
	files in blacklist.d, otherwise they expire because
	expiry uses file mtimes.
	Change nftfw_init.nft to add related accepts
	to the output chain, needed to be able to make
	sensible decisions about blocking connections
	later. Also tidy some of the extra packet output,
	and ensure that the lookback interface is handled
	properly.
	Documentation fix to How_do_i.
	Make Install delete files in etc/nftfw/original
	Add dropcounter to drop rules
	Add HTML output for nftfwls

v0.1.0  Move to github
