v0.4.2  Added blacklist_set_auto_merge and whitelist_set_auto_merge to
	config.ini.

        These two variables control the type of sets automatically
	generated for blacklist and whitelist tables. When true, nftfw
	uses auto_merged, interval sets for the blacklist or whitelist
	sets it makes. This set type automatically create single entries
	containing an address range for adjacent IP addresses. The feature
	is desirable because it reduces the number of matches.

        However, at present, the auto-merged, interval sets can cause the
	nft program to fail, flagging an error. There is a bug causing nft
	to succeed in loading the set when a full install is performed but
	failing when attempting a reload.

        The bug has been reported to the nftables development team, but no
	fix has been generated as of the current releases. nftfw will work
	around this bug, automatically generating a full install when an
	attempt at a set reload fails. However, it seems a good idea to
	provide a way of turning this feature off.

v0.4.1  Removed reject-www-data from default outgoing setting
	advice says that this causes more problems than it solves

v0.4.0  Change the README.md file, lots of what was there is
	now in other files.

v0.3.4  More documentation changes, make the geoiplocation code more
	robust.

v0.3.3  Change internal database interface slightly
	Add reset of missing files in blacklist.d, this has never happened
	but might.
	Update documentation

v0.3.2 	New document 'Installation Instructions'
	Augment logic in fwmanage. When adding a new IP into an set that
	creates a range, the partial load fails. Now test the partial load
	and do a full install when needed

v0.3.1  Put back the code that allows nftfwls to run
	without the python geoip2 package.
	Typo fixes in documents suggested by hairydog
	Changes to the Installation document
	New document 'Installing GeoLocation'
	New document 'Updating nftfw'

v0.2.3	Small change to the Installation document
	Added extra tests to test_04

v0.2.2  Added a set of pytest tests, which pulled out some omissions
	in checking, rather than actual bugs. See README files in
	the test directory. Added a Makefile to make linting the main
	source simpler.
	Tests needed a standalone bootstrap system, added to makefile
	Changed the way that ftp-helper is implemented

v0.2.1  Just when it looked fine, noticed an omission in the ipv6
	setup.

v0.2.0  Make a release - it seems to be functioning as expected


v0.1.9  Add some frequency stats to nftfwedit and log values from
	blacklist - puts some of the number into context

v0.1.8	Redo the management of Debian logger and how config.py interacts
	with other modules. New module loggermanager.py does this, and
	provides better control of what is happening.

	Large name changes to bring the code up to pylint standard, except
	I allow 1 and 2 character variable names, which are extremely
	local.
	argument-rgx=[a-z_][a-z0-9_]{0,30}$
	attr-rgx=[a-z_][a-z0-9_]{0,30}$
	also add 'log' to good-names otherwise it complains a lot
	about the log calls

	Revise commenting strategy to make is somewhat more formal


v0.1.7  Redo set naming algorithm.
	Change default blacklist action to drop which
	causes less traffic.
	Remove .patterns from argument to nftfw -p
	Fix a misconception in the nftfw_init.nft
	file.

v0.1.6	Blacklist won't blacklist addresses or networks
	in whitelist.d
	Reworked IP address checking into one place

v0.1.5  Fix typos in code highlighted by the installation
	on a vanilla Sympl system
	Update Installation document to incorporate things
 	learnt from the installation exercise

v0.1.4  Ensure glob in pattern match resolves to
	unique set of canonical files.
	Some amount of pythonification
	Add to installation documentation

v0.1.3 	Add nftfwedit to print info on IPs, and provide
	command line access to add, delete and blacklist
	ips.
	Documentation update

v0.1.2  Amend logging for blacklist detection to give an indication
	of what pattern triggered it.
	Add sample web page for nftfwls -w
	Add user control: files automatically created in etc/nftfw
	will be owned by user nominated in config.ini, this follows
	Symbiosis/Sympl practice of making files in etc/nftfw
	accessible to a non-root admin user
	Install.sh now asks for user name

v0.1.1 	Tidy links in documents
	Flatten distribution - removing original file tree for system.
	Replace 'dist' in etc_nftfw by 'original' to avoid
	problems with python package names.
	Seems like a good idea to have a ChangeLog.
	Change blacklist algorithm somewhat, realising
	that the update option needs to update times on
	files in blacklist.d, otherwise they expire because
	expiry uses file mtimes.
	Change nftfw_init.nft to add related accepts
	to the output chain, needed to be able to make
	sensible decisions about blocking connections
	later. Also tidy some of the extra packet output,
	and ensure that the lookback interface is handled
	properly.
	Documentation fix to How_do_i.
	Make Install delete files in etc/nftfw/original
	Add dropcounter to drop rules
	Add HTML output for nftfwls

v0.1.0  Move to github
