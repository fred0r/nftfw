Description: nftables firewall builder for Debian
 The nftfw package builds firewalls for nftables. Configuration is
 based on files stored in directories in /etc/nftfw. For example,
 adding a new IP address to the whitelist is done by creating a file
 named for the IP address in the whitelist.d directory. Adding a new
 rule permitting access to a port just takes the addition of a
 suitably named file in incoming.d. Blacklisting address ranges is
 done by adding a CIDR address to a file in blacknets.d.
 .
 nftfw can automatically maintain the blacklist by efficiently scanning
 log files using regular expressions and adding miscreant IP addresses
 into blacklist.d. It maintains a database of activity and will
 timeout the entries after a user-defined period. When an IP is
 blocked, nftfw allows for feedback from nftables to notice and
 maintain blocking for frequent attempts from unwanted visitors.
 .
 nftfw makes extensive use of nftables sets to maintain exclusion and
 inclusion lists. It tries to minimise changes to the live firewall by
 only updating sets that have changed. It adds its created statements
 to an nftables template that can be modified to extend the firewall
 setup if needed.
 .
 After installation, some configuration is needed to make the system active,
 see /usr/share/doc/nftfw/README.Debian
 .
 The package is written and developed in Python 3.7.
