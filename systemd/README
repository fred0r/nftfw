These two files will enable nftfw to run and load
nftables when contents of the control directories change.
These files are compatible with the manual installed version.
Separate files are used in the Debian package.

To install:

1) copy nftfw.path and nftfw.service to /etc/systemd/system

2) Start the path checking service

sudo systemctl start nftfw.path

2) Enable the unit so it will start in boot

sudo systemctl enable nftfw.path

and you are done.
