This directory contains import_to_nftfw.py to allow you to migrate your
Sympl or Symbiosis firewall settings into nftfw.

There are two types of information that's installed

Rules
=====
Checks and installs the contents of incoming.d and outgoing.d.

Files in incoming.d and outgoing.d access small files from rule.d to
generate firewall setup commands. nftfw has duplicated all of the operational
commands from Sympl/Symbiosis - but doesn't have synomyms, so a rule using
a Sympl/Symbiosis alias like 'allow' will be altered to the default 'accept'.
Some of the Sympl/Symbiosis rules are not needed by nftfw because that are
installed in the setup script nftfw_init.nft. Files using these rules are
not installed.

nftfw uses small shell scripts as rules, these are not compatible with the
Sympl/Symbiosis rule files that are written in ruby. The nftfw distribution
will update files in rule.d, and your own local rules should be placed in local.d.
If you have local rules or commands that import_rules doesn't understand, then
import_to_nftfw.py will flag them because they will need to be recoded.

Lists
=====
Checks and installs the contents of blacklist.d and whitelist.d. Can optionally
update the nftfw firewall database from automatically added entries in the
original blacklist.d

For more 'How to' information, run the command

$ sudo import_to_nftfw.py
