#  and sets 'root' - which is then
#  used in the following rules

# system locations used by nftfw
# NB sysetc location cannot be changed unless
# the ini file is used as the -c option
# to nftfw main scripts
;sysetc = ${root}/etc/nftfw

#  Location of system nftables.conf
#  Should be /etc/nftables.conf for production
#  But because we don't want to kill people's
#  systems when they first install nftfw
#  This will default to {sysexec}/nftables.conf
#  and installers will be asked to change it.

# The three variables below control the type of sets automatically
# generated for blacklist, blacknets and whitelist tables. When true,
# nftfw uses auto_merged, interval sets for the sets it makes. This
# set type automatically create single entries containing an address
# range for adjacent IP addresses. The feature is desirable because it
# reduces the number of matches.
#
# However, at present, the auto-merged, interval sets can cause the
# nft program to fail, flagging an error. There is a bug causing
# nft to succeed in loading the set when a full install is performed
# but failing when attempting a reload.
#
# The bug has been reported to the nftables development team, but no
# fix has been generated as of the current releases. nftfw will work
# around this bug, automatically generating a full install when an
# attempt at a set reload fails. However, it seems a good idea to
# provide a way of turning this feature on and default to
# not using the feature.

[Whitelist]
#  Whitelist constants

#  utmp file, otherwise set to a file

[Blacklist]
# Constants to manage blacklisting
# these depend on the matchcount value
# found from the logreader script
# NB Symbiosis had multiple records
# for each ip. This system only has one record
# but records timestamps. Expiry uses the
# complete record of activity from the ip
#
# Value in matchcount after which
# an ip is blocked using the ports in
# the rule (Symbiosis used 2)
;block_after = 10
#
# Value in matchcount after which
# an ip is blocked using all ports
;block_all_after = 100
#
# These depend on the time of last incident
#
# Number of days after which blacklisted ips
# should be expired. Symbiosis used 2
;expire_after = 10
#
# Database clean
# remove ip from the database where there has been
# no error posted for more than these number of days
;clean_before = 90

# 'nftfw blacklist' will check whether the IP addresses
# in the database that should be active are actually present
# in the blacklist directory _blacklist.d_. 'Should be active'
# means that the addresses have not been automatically expired.
# 'nftfw' is largely event driven, but events get missed. So
# on the basis that if stuff can happen, it will, this code
# will recover the correct state of the blacklist directory.
# It seems overkill to call this every time the blacklist scanner
# runs, so it is executed when number of runs of the scanner
# is greater than the value of this variable. The default is
# to run the blacklist scanner 96 times a day, so 50 seems
# are reasonable way to run the recovery code once a day. Set
# this to zero  to turn this feature off.
