This directory is the place to put locally modified or created rules.
Files should be called <FILE>.sh.
Files should be compatible with 'dash' and not 'bash'

Note that the rule.d directory might be altered by future distributions
so don't make any changes there.

Each rule is called twice, once for ip and once of ip6

The environment is set up as follows:
DIRECTION incoming | outgoing
PROTO - values ip|ip6
TABLE - usually filter
CHAIN - chain to add the rule to
PORTS - ports to use (can be empty)
COUNTER - set to counter or empty
IPS - ip addresses (can be empty, single, ranges, named sets, unnamed sets)
LOGGER - logger statement
       To replace this in a script use
       LOGGER='log prefix "STRING "'
       the space at the end of the string is needed
       to add a space in the log file
