These files and directories live in

/etc/nftfw
or
/usr/local/etc/nftfw

depending on your system. Once created, they will not be touched by
any update system. An original copy of what is uploaded can be
found in the 'original' directory (or symlink). These files will be
updated and can be used to reference.

Two files control the system:

		  to mass block address ranges.
